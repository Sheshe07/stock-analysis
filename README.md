# Green energy stock analysis:

## Overview of Project:

This project was based on finding the stock value between 2017 and 2018. In 2017 all stocks did good except the for the ending. The DQ stock did really well in 2017 return even though so parts were still high. And in 2018 only two company stocks did well based on my findings. The daily volume was high for DQ in 2018 but return percentage were low. Using Excel VBA we were able to collect various stock information between the year 2017 and 2018. 

### Purpose:

The purpose of this Data Analysis for stock of green energies companies is to see the daily volume and the return of the stocks.

### Background:

Because Steve parents are so passionate about green energy, they asked Steve for help to help them analyze there stocks in 2017 and 2018. They decided to invest in a solar panel company named DAQO New Energy Corp. Steve on the other hand asked us to help him analyze the data.

## Results:

### Stock Performance of 2017 & 2018:

The analysis shows the return investment for 99% of the stock was high in 2017. The DQ stock stands out as the daily volume was not so high but the return percentage was the highest for 2017 over all the other stocks. Overall, 2017 seems like a profitable year.
2018 was an underperformed year except for two stocks. ENPH and RUN, both of which also made a profit the previous year but seems like ENPH still underperformed but RUN did very well in 2018 then in 2017 with both the daily volume and the return.

## Summary:

Essentially editing the existing code to determine if it will run faster than the one with all the stocks analysis. For it to properly work, it needs to be done in small steps, the steps are completed without major changes to existing code. Creating the 3 variable and defining the index help with the speed process.

### Advantages & Disadvantages of Refactoring Code:

The script run faster with the refactored code, but you can potentially introduce bugs that your tests will not catch. When there are too many different data it can sometimes be complicated. You can remove something then find yourself adding it again with out noticing it.

### Advantages & Disadvantages of The Original & Refactored Code:

Refactoring tend to make the data neater and more precise.  It easier to make it readable by adding more comments for us or whomever wants to use the code in the future. Because the run times is shorter, it help boosts the system's performance. And make it runs smoother.
